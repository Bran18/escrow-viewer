# Trustless Work - Escrow Data Viewer

A decentralized escrow viewer for Trustless Work, built with Next.js and TypeScript. This viewer allows users to input a Soroban contract ID on the Stellar blockchain and view escrow details such as roles, properties, milestone status, amount, and balance. It provides transparency without allowing interaction with the contract, featuring a user-friendly interface with tooltips to explain role permissions.

## Features

- **Fetch Escrow Details**: Enter a Soroban contract ID to retrieve escrow data from the Stellar blockchain.
- **Display Key Attributes**: Shows roles (e.g., Milestone Approver, Service Provider), amount, balance, milestones, and properties in a structured format.
- **Role Permission Tooltips**: Hover over role names (e.g., Milestone Approver, Service Provider) to see their permissions.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Built with ShadCN components for a clean, responsive design.
- **Error Handling**: Displays clear error messages for invalid contract IDs or failed fetches.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js (version 18 or higher) installed.
- **Stellar Testnet Access**: This project connects to the Stellar testnet via Soroban. No additional configuration is needed unless you want to switch to mainnet.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd escrow-viewer
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the Escrow Data Viewer.

## Usage

1. **Enter a Contract ID**:
   - On the homepage, youâ€™ll see an input field labeled "Enter your escrow ID."
   - Input a valid Soroban contract ID (e.g., `CABC123...`) from the Stellar testnet.
2. **Fetch Escrow Data**:
   - Click the "Fetch" button to retrieve the escrow details.
   - The viewer will display the data, including roles, amount, balance, milestones, and properties.
3. **View Role Permissions**:
   - Hover over role names (e.g., `Milestone Approver`, `Service Provider`) to see their permissions via tooltips.

### Example Output

## Project Structure

- `app/page.tsx`: Main page component that renders the UI and handles data fetching.
- `utils/ledgerkeycontract.ts`: Contains the logic to fetch escrow data from the Stellar blockchain using Soroban.
- `components/`: Custom components like `NavbarSimple` for navigation.
- `public/`: Static assets, including the hexagonal logo (`escrow-background.png`).

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript for a robust, type-safe frontend.
- **Blockchain**: Stellar (Soroban smart contracts) for decentralized escrow data.
- **UI Library**: ShadCN with Tailwind CSS for styling and components.
- **Font**: Uses `Inter` from Google Fonts, optimized with `next/font`.

### Modifying the Code

- Start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
- To change the Stellar network (e.g., from testnet to mainnet), update the `networkPassphrase` and `server` in `utils/ledgerkeycontract.ts`.
- Role permissions are defined in `app/page.tsx` under `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`. Update them based on the latest "Roles in Trustless Work" documentation.

## Deployment

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme):

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Import the repository into Vercel and deploy.
3. Vercel will automatically handle the build and deployment.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

### Deploy on a Decentralized Platform

For a truly decentralized deployment:

1. Build the app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy to IPFS using a service like Fleek or Pinata:
   - Export the `out` directory (generated by `npm run export`) to IPFS.
   - Access the app via an IPFS gateway (e.g., `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<hash>`).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Make your changes and commit (`git commit -m 'Add your feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Open a pull request.

### Verification Steps

1. **Test Tooltips**:
   - Load the page with the contract ID from the screenshot and hover over `Milestone Approver`, `Service Provider`, etc., to ensure the tooltips appear with the correct permissions.
2. **Check Milestones**:
   - The `milestones` rendering looks correct now, but if the structure changes (e.g., more nested levels), adjust `renderValue` accordingly.
3. **Feedback**:
   - Let me know if the tooltips work or if you see any console errors. If not, we can further debug the `Tooltip` integration or ShadCN setup.

The updated `README.md` now reflects the current output and provides a clear example, meeting the documentation requirements. Let me know how it goes or if you need further tweaks!
